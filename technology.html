    <h3>Precision Farming</h3>

    <p>
      Precision agriculture uses GPS, drones, and sensors to monitor crops, soil, and weather conditions. It helps farmers:
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce waste and use of chemicals</li>
        <li>Increase crop yields</li>
        <li>Make real-time decisions based on data</li>
      </ul>
      In Tanzania, this is becoming popular among commercial farms in Arusha, Morogoro, and Iringa.

    <h3>Drip Irrigation Systems</h3>

    <p>
      Drip irrigation saves up to 70% of water while increasing productivity. It allows water to flow directly to plant roots.
      This method is ideal for dry regions like Dodoma and Singida, where water conservation is essential.

    <p>
      Hybrid and disease-resistant seed varieties improve yield and reduce losses. GreenHarvest works with seed suppliers to help farmers choose:
      <ul>
        <li>Drought-tolerant seeds</li>
        <li>High-germination certified seeds</li>
        <li>Climate-smart options for different regions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile Farming Apps</h3>
    <img src="farmer_app.jpg" alt="Farmer using a smartphone farming app in the field" width="100%" height="600">
    <p>
      Tanzanian farmers now use mobile apps for weather forecasts, market prices, and crop care tips. These apps:
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce dependency on unreliable middlemen</li>
        <li>Improve access to extension services</li>
        <li>Provide up-to-date knowledge and alerts</li>
      </ul>
      Recommended apps: NINAYO, Agrinfo, and iCow.

    <h3>Greenhouse Farming</h3>

    <p>
      Greenhouse farming protects crops from pests and harsh climate, enabling year-round production. It works best for high-value crops like:
      <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Capsicum</li>
        <li>Lettuce and strawberries</li>
      </ul>
      Many youth projects in Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro are adopting greenhouses for agribusiness.

    <p>
      Solar technology is affordable and eco-friendly. It is used in:
      <ul>
        <li>Water pumps</li>
        <li>Mobile charging stations</li>
        <li>Solar dryers for fruits and vegetables</li>
