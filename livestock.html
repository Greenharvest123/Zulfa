  <h1>Livestock Management at GreenHarvest</h1>
  <p>At GreenHarvest, we empower Tanzanian farmers with essential knowledge, tools, and guidance to improve livestock production sustainably. Livestock is not just a source of foodâ€”it's a source of income, nutrition, and pride for many families.</p>

  <h2>Major Livestock Categories</h2>

  <h3>1. Cattle Farming</h3>

  <p>Cattle farming is a key part of agriculture in Tanzania. We promote sustainable cattle rearing by teaching farmers about proper breeds, disease control, feeding programs, and pasture management.</p>

  <h3>2. Poultry Farming</h3>

  <p>Poultry farming, especially with layers and broilers, is a fast-growing income opportunity. We provide training on modern poultry housing, vaccination, and feed formulas to improve egg and meat production.</p>

  <h3>3. Goat and Sheep Farming</h3>
